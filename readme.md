## File description
<b>src/challenge_2021.ipynb</b>: Jupyter notebook with the code and visualization plots

<b>src/main.py</b>: python file with the source code

It is more preferable to run or open the jupyter notebook because it contains several
visualizations of different parameters

<b>requirements</b>: A txt file with the libraries needed in order to run the notebook or the .py file.

## Running the notebook
It is required to have downloaded and installed Anaconda beforehand.
By opening an anaconda prompt and typing ```jypyter notebook```
a tab appears in a web browser. By selecting and then opening the jupyter notebook
several runs have already been run, so the plots are already visible.

Files such as the .pdf, the plots and the data have not been included in this
